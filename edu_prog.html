										<h3>Learning transcends the sum of content knowledge and skills</h3>
										<p>Content and skills are crucial elements of the learning-teaching process; however, how we connect and articulate those elements is the foundation of <b>transformative thinking and action</b>. My approach is to create a teaching environment <b>centred on students’ experiences and aspirations</b>, allowing students to examine how these elements connect to the content and skills required to address global environmental health challenges.</p> 
										<p>This strategy has two goals. First, elucidating the <b>connection between the course material and the student’s perspective of the world is a source of motivation</b>. Guiding students to reflect on the linkages between global health issues and their individual and collective backgrounds, creates a long-lasting relationship with the content and skills beyond the requirements of the course. 
										    Second, the health geography and the global environmental health fields draw on a wide range of skills and topics and is evolving to understand the multiple connections and scales driving planetary health issues. Thus, learning should develop students’ abilities to <b>critically appraise connections</b> between different themes, skills, and disciplines as well as their positionality toward those elements.</p>
										<hr />
										<h3> </h3>
										<h3>Creating and delivering knowledge sharing experiences</h3>
										<p>My teaching philosophy has been shaped by more than <b>15 years of experience teaching in different countries, with students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels</b>. 
											In addition to having been a TA for numerous courses both in Latin America and Canada, I designed and taught courses, served as a methodological advisor, and supervised graduate students.</p>

											<h3>Teaching values</h3>
											<p>As an educator I draw on my experiences in Latin America, Africa, and North America to provide students with the <b>foundations to navigate the multi-level intricacies of planetary health threats</b> from an <b>environmental justice and decolonial lens</b>. 
												In particular, I aim to foster an environment of <b>inclusivity and humility</b> in the discussions and reflections on health equity issues. In addition to discussing these principles with students to promote a <b>respectful and open dialogue that represents the diversity of students</b>, I design courses to reflect these principles.</p>
