											<h3>Indigenous Food Systems</h3>
											<p>In addition to my work at national and global scales, I have conducted local research based on 
												<b>horizontal collaborative partnerships that account for the connection between local contamination and globalized systems</b>. For example, my dissertation builds on ourI co-led a marine toxicology research in collaboration with the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation.
												<b>Our research highlights the benefits of collaborations with Indigenous Peoples</b> to strengthen study validity, promote solution-based frameworks, improve risk communication, and strengthen communities’ self-reliance.</p>

											<h3>Perinatal health and environmental pesticies exposures</h3>
											<p>In this study, <b>we analyzed ~500k birth and fetal death records</b> to provide national-level evidence of the spatial distribution of low birth weight (LBW) and fetal death in Ecuador and their association with
												pesticide application rates in 2015 and 2016. Through a combination of data-driven spatial
												cluster detection and Bayesian spatial modelling, <b>we identified areas of elevated risk of LBW
												and fetal death</b>. In addition, we assessed how the spatial effect of these perinatal outcomes is
												accounted by the covariates in our models. Overlapping areas of elevated risk for both perinatal
												outcomes were observed in the central Coast and Inter-Andean region. Moreover, we found
												weak evidence that living in areas with high levels of pesticides use may be associated with a
												slight increased risk of LBW and fetal death.</p>

										<h3> Harnessing big Data, mapping, and health geography to identify areas of pesticide contamination concern in Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMIC) </h3>
										<p> The extensive and increasing application of pesticides in agriculture is receiving more recognition as a major chemical pollution challenge due to its severe impacts on human health and ecosystems' ecological integrity.
											<b>Global food systems are increasingly relying on intensive agricultural practices in LMIC</b>, establishing as major drivers of global environmental change and expanding chemical exposures where national-level exposure controls, monitoring, and data are limited. 
											Environmental exposures to pesticides through agricultural drift are particularly concerning for LMIC, where there is often high pesticide application rates, and 
											less separation between farming and other land uses, <b>contributing to widen local and global health disparities</b>. 
											
										<p> Moreover, exposure assessments are usually contained to the occupational settings of workers handling pesticides, and favour recommendations centred on promoting safety behaviours. 
											In contrast, the environmental exposure of populations living in intensive agriculture landscapes, where individuals have limited agency to control exposures, is understudied and lacks monitoring and controls.</p>

										<p> <b>Using Ecuador as a case study, I developed a geospatial research tool to integrate global pesticide use data, population density, and ecosystem integrity indicators </b>. 
											This allowed us to analyze the distribution of application rates and identify regions of concern because of high potential exposure to human populations and strategic ecosystems. In addition, 
											we found that about <b>a third of the population in Ecuador live in areas with high pesticide applicaiton rates </b>. 
										    Our study is a step towards understanding this planetary health threat in a country with one of the highest application rates of pesticides worldwide, an export-bound agricultural industry, a large
											population at risk, remarkable biodiversity and ecosystems, and a limited understanding of the nationwide extent of pesticide contamination. <b>We found widespread and alarming intensive use
											of pesticides in Ecuador in regions that overlap with human populations and ecosystems at risk of exposure </b>.</p>									

										 <p>While our study focused on Ecuador, it is unlikely that the widespread risk of exposure
											in this country is an isolated case. Countries may have different spatial and temporal
											arrangements of agricultural production where human populations and natural ecosystems are at
											differential risk of exposure to pesticides. <b>This study’s accessible, modular, and scalable methods can be replicated worldwide.
											Moreover, they can be adapted to local priorities, and additional data (e.g., water scarcity, malnutrition) could be
											integrated to identify areas of concern based on multiple criteria.</b> </p>
