										<h3>Malaria and Gold Mining in the Amazon</h3>
										<p>We are collaborating with the Department of Guanía (Colombia) to assess the spatial distribution and drivers of malaria infection in the peri-urban areas, which are mainly inhabited by Indigenous Peoples and migrant workers from mines located in the Colombian and Venezuelan Amazon. We are using remotely sensed imagery of mining activity, forest cover, and proxies of climate change, and data on the distribution of the malaria vector and infection cases, human mobility patterns, mining surveys, and mercury contamination in fish and human hair.</p>
										
										<p>I am leading the mercury contamination analysis, conceptualized both as an indicator of mining activity and a potential factor influencing individual infection severity. Moreover, these analyses intersect with my research stream on globalized food systems contamination, as fish, which can bioaccumulate mercury, are key to the Amazon population’s well-being. This is particularly important in Colombia, where mercury contamination in fish is a seldom recognized issue despite the country having the highest rate of mercury emission from artisanal gold and the second-highest freshwater fish biodiversity globally.</p>

											<h3>Scaling Dynamics of Malaria Infection and Human Population</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/toldillo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>Colombia has had one of the largest numbers of internally displaced populations in the world and in 2016 entered a period of post-conflict. 
												These socio-ecological and geopolitical processes and trends have increased the migration of people towards cities and accordingly are affecting the distribution and occurrence of tropical diseases in its urban and peri-urban areas.</p>
											<p> We explored these relationships and dynamics using statistical analyses and available geospatial data to identify the scale relationships be­tween urban growth processes and disease transmission in Colombia. 
												Our results show that the dynamics of rural populations and certain diseases were characterized by power-laws that are indeed observed in urbanization studies. However, as opposed to these other studies, we found that malaria presented a higher intensity of infection in human settlements with less than 50,000 individuals and in particular for ethnic, indigenous pop­ulations.</p>

											<h3>Urban Dengue & Environmental Change<</h3>
											
											<p>Changes in global and local environmental variables are linked to the distribution and density of di-sease vectors. The study’s objective was to estimate the relation between the entomological indicator of immature and adult forms of the Aedes aegypti mosquito per unit area and the environmental variables in rural areas of two municipalities in Colombia. </p>
											<p>A combination of collected field data (infestation rates of adult and immature forms of the vector in rural homes), digital elevation models and monitoring weather stations were used to estimate the relation between the variables of interest. Four spatial 
											  regression models were implemented</p>
